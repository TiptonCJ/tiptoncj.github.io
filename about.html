    <h2>Hello! I'm Carter Tipton</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science graduate from Appalachian State University. I pursued a Data Science concentration with my degree, completed a Statistics minor, 
      and a variety of certificates I received through school programs. These certificates include Data Science(via the concentration), Python, AI, Querying Data, and Intercultual Skills.
      I graduated in December of 2025 and currently work full time at Dougnet Computer Consulting in Boone, NC, but am actively searching for a full-time job outside of Boone. 
    <br><br>
      Growing up, I discovered my passion for technology the same way many others do: video games. Playing games like Minecraft and Poptropica on my parent's computer helped grow my interests in 
      technology but also sparked my love for puzzle games. I loved the challenge of solving puzzles and figuring out how things worked, which naturally led me to programming. When I wasn't playing
      games, odds are I was on the baseball field. Since starting T-ball at five years old, baseball has been a massive part of my life. I played year round all the way through high school where I 
      played varsity all four years. My experience with baseball taught me so much about teamwork, discipline, and hard work. 
    <br><br>
      My interests in tech took a big jump in high school when I built my first computer. I wanted to get more invested in learning about computers and programming and thought,
      "what better way to learn than to build my own?" Building my first PC was a very fun experience, researching parts, learning how they work together, and then finally putting it all together.
      By the time I was done, I knew tech was where I wanted to be. As I conntinued to explore and learn more about programming, I found myself drawn to data science and machine learning. I grew more
      curious about how people used data to discover insights and make decisions, and it seemed to me like a big puzzle where the data was the pieces and I decided that I wanted to learn how to put them together.
      This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science at Appalachian State University. 
    <br><br>
      While at college, I decided to join my brother at the App State Jiu Jitsu club. My brother was a senior and the club president at the time. The club and sport quickly became a 
      huge part of my life. I went to BJJ classes/sessions up to six times a week. Not only did I really enjoy the sport, but I also wanted to impress my brother(and maybe beat him). After he graduated, 
      I took on the role of club president and it became a true passion of mine. With the help of some other dedicated members, we grew the club to over 50 active and paid memmbers. As president, I took on 
      most rolls in the club, including organizing weekly classes, managing finances, fundraisers, and organizing events with other college clubs. Thankfully, I had a close friends who was much more experienced
      in BJJ and could coach the classes. This club is my proudest accomplishment in college. Creating an environment where people can come together, learn, and grow in a sport I love has been incredibly rewarding.
      Not only is it a safe place for students to learn a martial art, but it also fosters a sense of community and friendship among members, it's where I met my girlfriend who i've been with for over three years now.
      Not to mention, the club is very successful, many members have competed in a variety of events, like our annual college tournament, hosted at UNC Chapel Hill, or at regional tournaments where we've won many medals.
      I've learned so much from this experience, from leadership and organization to the importance of community and support, to the perseverance and dedication required to succeed in a sport like Jiu Jitsu.
    <br><br>
      Having graduated, I am now working full time at Dougnet Computer Consulting in Boone, NC, while actively searching for full-time opportunities outside of Boone. 
      I continue to apply my skills in data science and machine learning, and am eager to take on new challenges in the tech industry. My capstone project, Diamondtrack, 
      a live baseball stats tracking app, was a highlight of my academic career, combining my passion for baseball with my technical skills.

      Please explore this website to see some projects of mine and links to my resume, linkedIn, and contact information. 
      I'm always happy to connect with fellow students, professionals, or anyone interested in technology and data science.
