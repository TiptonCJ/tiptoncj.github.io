    <h1>Mountain Mayhem</h1>
    <p>
        This is a simple game where you navigate through a mountain range, avoiding obstacles and collecting items.<br>
        I built this entirely in Java. Since submitting this project in my Sophmore year, I have learned a lot more about Java and game development.<br>
        The game is currently in a weird state due to the fact that I had made a lot of improvements to the game but it is very much still a work in progress.<br>
